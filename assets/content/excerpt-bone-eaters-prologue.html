    <p>
        Castus pushed his way through the dense underbrush of the ancient forest.
        It had been a long, gruelling journey but now it was close to done. The
        young wizard allowed himself a weary smile which twisted to a grimace, as
        pain stabbed through his face. His left eye throbbed painfully, a dirty
        white handkerchief wrapped roughly around his head, serving as a makeshift
        bandage. He was unsure if he would ever be able to see through the eye
        again but, as he doubted he would survive the day, it hardly mattered.
    </p>

    <p>
        From his gnawing hunger pains, Castus guessed it was now close to lunch.
        It seemed oddly cruel that his last meal might be his breakfast of mouldy
        cheese and rock-hard, stale bread, that he had to fight to keep down. He
        took a sip from his water flask, soothing his dry, parched throat. It was
        almost empty. He could hear a stream bubbling nearby, mocking him cruelly.
        His thirst was desperate, but he didn't trust this forest or any of its
        bounty.
    </p>

    <p>
        He took a moment to observe his surroundings. The forest wasn't entirely
        unpleasant, though little light made it through the canopy. The trees
        reached skyward, straining for the sunlight shining somewhere above him.
        Leaves, dirt, and ivy littered the ground around him. He hadn't seen any
        animals since he set out in the morning—not so much as a wagtail flew
        between the branches, yet Castus knew he was being watched. Whispers
        seemed to carry in the stillness, just out of reach and impossible to
        comprehend. Was it the trees talking, or something in their branches? The
        air was oppressive, and Castus had to fight to keep his thoughts clear.
    </p>

    <p>
        He sat on a fallen log and carefully placed his staff close by, never out
        of arm's reach. He was getting closer to their hive, or their nest,
        whatever these unseelie fae called the forsaken place of evil they lived.
        Castus had seen a handful of bone eaters slaughter and devour a small
        animal in seconds. The skin and flesh left to decay and rot. True to their
        name, bone eaters were interested in the marrow—piercing the skin and
        burrowing into the victim's skeleton. It was unsurprising that Castus had
        seen no living creatures in this part of the forest.
    </p>

    <p>
        Castus took another mouthful of water, picked up his staff, stood and
        stretched. Every muscle in his tall frame offered protest. His boyish
        handsomeness was now hidden behind a thin, scraggly beard and a mess of
        unkempt, wispy blonde hair. Months in the wilderness had not been kind to
        Castus. He pointlessly brushed off his filthy, rough tunic as he stood.
        The top layer of dirt performed a dusty little dance and landed happily
        back in its place. His boots, though covered in mud, were of good make and
        still sound. His one good eye, blue and clear, assessed the path ahead.
    </p>

    <p>
        'So, Castus the foolish has arrived at his doom.' The voice echoed in his
        mind, high-pitched and mocking. Castus wasn't sure if it was a private
        torment or something the whole forest could hear, though it made little
        difference as he seemed the forest's sole occupant. Castus the foolish, a
        nickname he had picked up as a student, his brilliance had not been
        tempered with wisdom then. Once again, he found himself living up to his
        name, fighting a fight no one else was foolish enough to.
    </p>

    <p>
        Castus took a step, and as if triggered, six tiny faeries dropped from the
        branches above. Their skin, grey-white, drawn tightly over their frames,
        giving them a skeletal appearance. Their large, soulless black eyes and
        sharp, pointed features were accentuated by ears that jutted almost higher
        than their heads. Their thin, oily black hair framing a lipless grin,
        revealing razor-sharp, pointed teeth.
    </p>

    <p>
        The faeries flew incredibly fast, screaming unintelligibly as they dove
        towards Castus' face and neck. Castus' grip on his staff tightened and it
        grew warm to the touch. The runes tattooed on his arms, back, and chest
        also grew warm, and faintly glowed. Castus the foolish, perhaps, Castus
        the unprepared, never.
    </p>

    <p>
        The faeries bounced off the invisible barrier the rune magic provided.
        Furious, chittering manically, the bone eaters regrouped and tried the
        assault again. It was as futile as the first attack. Castus smirked wryly
        and the faeries retreated, enraged.
    </p>

    <p>
        Castus slowly but deliberately continued walking. The ground began to rise
        steeply and every step felt harder than the last. His breath was ragged.
        It was hard to keep track of time in the forest but the young wizard
        guessed barely half an hour had passed as he crested the top of the hill.
        From his vantage point Castus surveyed the dell below him. It looked not
        unlike every other part of the forest he had been in, but he knew he had
        arrived at his destination.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the bottom of the small valley was a dead tree, the yellowing white
        colour of old bone. No life or green could be seen anywhere on its
        branches. The ancient tree stood alone, nothing grew near it, a barren
        circle of lifelessness spread out from its long-dead roots. In its
        petrified branches hung the fae nest. It reminded Castus of a wasp's nest,
        papery grey-white, and massive in size. From this distance it looked like
        swarms of insects were busying themselves around the tree. Castus knew
        better though, the swarms flitting in and around the branches of the tree
        were bone eaters—hundreds, perhaps thousands of them.
    </p>

    <p>
        Castus drew on all his resolve, and continued his journey, heading into
        the valley. As soon as he started his descent, the swarms of faeries
        alighted on the tree's branches, watching him. It reminded Castus of a
        class full of magically attuned, hyperactive youngsters settling down as a
        teacher sweeps into the classroom.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thousands of hungry eyes followed him, watching him as he drew closer. The
        noise of their chittering now louder. Castus could not understand any of
        their language, but it was ugly and full of malice. A few yards from the
        tree, the voice returned to his head, louder, piercing, it reverberated
        through his skull.
    </p>

    <p>
        'You shouldn't have come Wizard.' The voice came from within his own head,
        but there was one faery, sitting atop the trunk of the dead tree, where
        the branches forked away from each other. Castus knew they were the one
        talking to him—the Queen. All the movement of the other faeries revolved
        around her, and she controlled them like a puppeteer making a marionette
        dance. While she looked directly at Castus, her eyes full of hatred and
        cruelty, the eyes of the other faeries all gazed at her in worship. Her
        dress seemed to grow on her, like black lichen. She wore a silver circlet
        on her head like a crown, the silver crafted into a vine, with smaller
        gemstones set into its surface.
    </p>

    <p>
        'I did not want to,' replied Castus plainly. 'You started this, and I had
        no choice. The villagers have always given the forest a wide berth and
        accepted it was the domain of the fae.'
    </p>

    <p>
        It was true, every child in Hogmarsh was warned to never climb the wall.
        It sat as the border between the forest and the village. Many an
        adventurous boy or girl had the memory of a beating for even playing near
        the barrier. The ancient ruins of a keep at the edge of the forest now the
        only sign that humans had once lived here, coexisting with the fae. Castus
        was, possibly, the first human to walk among these trees for hundreds of
        years.
    </p>

    <p>
        'You broke the peace,' uneasy as it had been, Castus left that thought
        unspoken. 'Desecrating the graves is almost forgivable, but taking a
        child?' As he mentioned the child the chittering grew louder, the queen's
        hungry grin stretched wider, her black, forked tongue flicking through her
        teeth.
    </p>

    <p>
        'Delicious.' Almost a whisper, the word started at the back of Castus'
        head, reverberated down his spine and landed firmly in the pit of his
        stomach.
    </p>

    <p>
        'So, here I am,' Castus spoke calmly, almost pitiably. He was revolted by
        these creatures. 'I will do everything I can to stop you, and if I cannot,
        I will die content knowing I tried.'
    </p>

    <p>
        'Castus the foolish, you will die, and you will die in agony. I have
        summoned all my fae. My children are hungry, you cannot hope to stand
        against us.' The chittering and clicking of the faeries grew to a
        crescendo. Castus did not have to understand their language to know they
        were laughing at him.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>All of the Fae?</em> He had assumed there would be stragglers, bone
        eaters who would escape his curse, and still pose some danger. His
        expression gave away nothing, he must not let the queen sense his
        unexpected hope.
    </p>

    <p>
        'We have been following you, watching,' continued the queen. 'My fae
        report back to me. We have seen you, putting up your little protection
        spells around the village and around our forest. Hoping to save the
        humans, like a dutiful master protecting a pet. I do not know why you
        bother, they are so feeble and you are so much more powerful—you belong
        with us.'
    </p>

    <p>
        Castus was only half listening. The queen's arrogance was her weakness,
        she underestimated mortals. His hand grew warm on his staff as he drew on
        the magic found deep in the fabric of the earth.
    </p>

    <p>
        'Don't you know, the Rune protections you placed on the village, on the
        wall, on the edges of our forest, need an anchor?' The queen's mocking
        laughter, echoing around the wizard's head. 'Everything in the forest is
        under my dominion. No curse could hold us for long.'
    </p>

    <p>
        Castus looked at the creature in front of him. So much evil in such a
        small thing. 'I have studied more ancient rune magic than even you. I have
        delved into darker places than this forest, uncovering ancient tomes, long
        thought lost.' Castus tried hard not to think about the crypts and
        catacombs he had spent more than a year searching. 'I don't just need an
        anchor in this forest, but a living soul.'
    </p>

    <p>
        Castus straightened himself to full height and raised his staff above his
        head. Magic began whirling around him in a ball of lightning and wind. The
        fae, at the command of their mistress, erupted in a frenzied, murderous
        attack, trying to pierce the protections around the wizard. The barrier
        around Castus held. While he was unharmed, the faeries were left in agony.
        The energy of their momentum was turned into heat and light by the
        wizard's arcane shield, burning their flesh. Without acknowledging their
        pain, the attack continued without relent.
    </p>

    <p>
        Castus desperately willed his luck to hold just a while longer. His
        protections were anchored to the staff in his hand, but there were no
        protections on the staff itself. If any of the fae realised this and
        directed an attack on his staff, all his defences would be broken. But the
        faeries, so clouded by rage, continued their frontal assault—hurling
        themselves directly at Castus, harming none by themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
        'As long as I breathe, I curse you,' declared Castus, his voice raised,
        magically amplified against the cacophony of the bone eaters. As he spoke,
        he moved his staff in the air writing ancient runes. The intricate
        markings floated in the air around him, glowing like fire. 'You shall
        never eat the bones of another human again.'
    </p>

    <p>
        The runes he had written descended on Castus, binding themselves to him.
        As comprehension dawned on the queen, she screamed. The sound unbearable,
        full of fury and frustration. Her army of fae paused their attack,
        paralysed, covering their ears, holding their heads in agony.
    </p>

    <p>
        'As long as I breathe,' he repeated. The power of these words was finally
        clear to the Fae Queen—while Castus lived, the curse would hold. He had
        made his own life the magical anchor.
    </p>

    <p>
        The wizard allowed himself an uncharacteristic gloat. Self-satisfaction
        evident and, with just a little spite, he added, 'The only human bones you
        will be able to touch, are the teeth that fall freely from the mouths of
        children, and even then you will have to pay for them in gold.' The final
        rune burned into his chest. Castus fought to remain upright, he needed his
        protections to last long enough for him to retreat.
    </p>

    <p>
        Fury and hatred burned in the fae queen.
    </p>

    <p>
        'We live longer than you Castus,' she spat. 'Our hunger is eternal. You
        will eventually die, and we never forget.' Castus knew this. He would live
        as long as he could, and he would never be able to leave the forest, but
        the village would be safe, at least for a few generations.
    </p>

    <p>
        Castus did not answer her, he simply turned and left. He would head for
        the old Keep, he had spent some time giving it extra protections. Arthur
        was waiting for him there. Castus would live out his remaining days in the
        forest and do everything he could to live as long as possible. Arthur had
        ways to prolong life, though not wholesome ones, and he had to make sure
        to never lose his soul completely, or there would be no anchor.
    </p>

    <p>
        Everything the fae queen had said was true. Bone eaters are immortal,
        their hunger is never satiated, and nothing quite tasted as sweet as
        children's bones. Bound by the curse, but unable to resist food, feeling
        such humiliation, hatred burning, they took the teeth of the children, and
        they paid.
    </p>

    <p>
        For a time, there was peace.
    </p>
