    <p>
        Remy stood in the room again.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was already full.
    </p>

    <p>
        Boxes were stacked from floor to ceiling, crowded and leaning, in every shape and size imaginable. Some were small enough to clutch to the chest. Others were so large they sagged beneath their own weight. Each bore a label written in Remy's own hand.
    </p>

    <p>
        Or rather—by versions of it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some labels were written in the careful, uneven scrawl of a small child, letters too large, some backwards, the ink smudged where tears had fallen. Others were scratched out in a hurried, angry teenage hand. A few were neat and controlled, written by an adult who had learned how to make pain look orderly.
    </p>

    <p>
        The words were simple.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Too much. Wrong. Hide this. Don't let them see.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        The boxes shook.
    </p>

    <p>
        They hissed and shouted and accused, their voices overlapping until the room throbbed with sound. From inside came growls and whispers, weeping and laughter too sharp to be kind. They spoke in borrowed voices—rules learned early, sermons repeated until they felt like truth.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>You should know better. This is what you really are. If anyone saw this, they would turn away.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        Remy hated this room.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once, long ago, there had been only one box.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was filled on a day when Remy's feelings arrived all at once and far too loudly. He had been tired and hungry and disappointed, and the world felt unfair in a way he could not yet name. The feeling tore out of him in screams and kicking and sobbing. His face burned. His body shook. He wanted comfort and received correction instead.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Stop that. You're being ridiculous. There's nothing to cry about.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        Hands restrained him. Voices hardened. Someone said his name with warning in it.
    </p>

    <p>
        The feeling did not disappear.
    </p>

    <p>
        So Remy crushed it down.
    </p>

    <p>
        He gathered the fear and rage and grief and forced it into a box, slamming the lid shut. Inside, the feeling twisted and darkened, growing teeth and claws in the dark.
    </p>

    <p>
        The quiet that followed felt like safety.
    </p>

    <p>
        Next, was a lie.
    </p>

    <p>
        Remy learned that some truths earned frowns. That honesty could bring punishment disguised as disappointment. So he said what was expected instead. The lie slid easily into place.
    </p>

    <p>
        Later, alone, he boxed the truth he had swallowed. Left in the dark, it warped, sharpening at the edges.
    </p>

    <p>
        The next box was jealousy.
    </p>

    <p>
        It came sudden and hot—a wanting he had been taught was ugly. He buried it quickly. In the dark, it learned to sneer.
    </p>

    <p>
        After that, the boxes came faster.
    </p>

    <p>
        Any feeling named improper. Any thought labeled dangerous. Any impulse declared wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each one, sealed away, grew stranger. Shadows pressed against the cardboard. The longer they were hidden, the less human they became.
    </p>

    <p>
        By the time Remy was grown, the boxes required a room.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside it, he was acceptable. Controlled. Good.
    </p>

    <p>
        Inside it, monsters screamed to be seen.
    </p>

    <p>
        And Remy was empty.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then he met Agatha.
    </p>

    <p>
        Agatha was inconvenient in the way living things are inconvenient to cages. She felt her feelings openly and made no effort to soften them for the comfort of others.
    </p>

    <p>
        One day, she was furious.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was not quiet fury. It came with sharp words, foul looks, and language that made the air feel scorched. She paced, hands thrown wide, jaw tight, eyes blazing. Her anger was messy and uncontained and very much alive.
    </p>

    <p>
        Remy felt the old reflex seize his chest.
    </p>

    <p>
        'Do you need a box?' he asked. 'I know where to hide that.'
    </p>

    <p>
        Agatha stopped short.
    </p>

    <p>
        'A box?' she said.
    </p>

    <p>
        'To keep the ugly parts out of sight,' Remy said, already shrinking.
    </p>

    <p>
        She looked at him steadily. 'No. I'm angry because something is wrong. This doesn't need to be hidden.'
    </p>

    <p>
        Something in her certainty unsettled him.
    </p>

    <p>
        For a long moment, Remy said nothing. His mind raced through all the reasons not to continue—how she would recoil, how she would see him differently, how this might be the moment she decided he was too much after all.
    </p>

    <p>
        His hand found the door before he had fully decided.
    </p>

    <p>
        'I need to show you something,' he said quietly. 'But… you don't have to come.'
    </p>

    <p>
        The words tasted like risk.
    </p>

    <p>
        The door creaked open.
    </p>

    <p>
        The noise rushed out.
    </p>

    <p>
        Remy almost closed it again. His chest tightened, his shame flaring hot and urgent.
    </p>

    <p>
        'This is why I don't bring people here,' he said. 'This is why I don't let them see.'
    </p>

    <p>
        Agatha did not step back.
    </p>

    <p>
        The boxes shrieked when they saw her. Shadows battered the walls. Remy waited for disgust. For fear. For her to leave.
    </p>

    <p>
        She did none of those things.
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead, she knelt beside one of the smallest boxes, its label written in a child's clumsy hand.
    </p>

    <p>
        'May we open one?' she asked.
    </p>

    <p>
        Remy swallowed hard. 'Only one.'
    </p>

    <p>
        They opened the box.
    </p>

    <p>
        Something rushed out—fast and frightened and loud. It filled the space with flailing limbs and sharp edges, with a panic that had nowhere to go. Remy shrank back, heart pounding, certain this was proof of everything he had feared.
    </p>

    <p>
        Agatha stayed.
    </p>

    <p>
        She did not raise her voice. She did not step away. She simply remained where she was until the storm spent itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        Slowly, the shape faltered.
    </p>

    <p>
        The sharpness softened. The noise broke into sobs. What had seemed monstrous drew in on itself, small and shaking.
    </p>

    <p>
        And then Remy saw it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not a creature from the dark—but a piece of himself, folded wrong for too long. A part that had been shouting because it had never been answered.
    </p>

    <p>
        Agatha knelt and held it as one might hold a crying child.
    </p>

    <p>
        After a moment, Remy did too.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then it was only the two of them, holding each other.
    </p>

    <p>
        They did not open another box that day.
    </p>

    <p>
        But when they left the room, it felt different. Not empty. Not quiet. Just… less afraid.
    </p>

    <p>
        And Remy understood, not in words but in his bones:
    </p>

    <p>
        Nothing here was forbidden.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nothing here was beyond keeping.
    </p>

    <p>
        These were not things to be locked away.
    </p>

    <p>
        They were things that had been waiting.
    </p>

    <p>
        They would open the rest.
    </p>

    <p>
        Slowly. Carefully.
    </p>

    <p>
        With love.
    </p>
