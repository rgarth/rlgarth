    <p class="chapter-title">The Lawnmower</p>

    <p>
        Mr Lemon had difficulty opening the shed, grass had grown in front of the
        tin door and the rusty hinges were stiff. Eventually, it opened and he
        dragged out their very old lawnmower. Penelope stuck her head in to have
        a look around the shed. It was a mess. There were cobwebs over the windows.
        Old, disused tools covered every dusty surface. Penelope wasn't sure if
        there was a pair of anything. Lots of single gardening gloves, toolboxes
        with gaps where tools should be, assorted screws and nails in jars.
        Penelope was also sure the shed was making a fine home for at least a few
        of the garden's gnomes. She saw one peering up at her from behind a spade
        resting on the wall. She smiled and waved at the fearsome-looking fellow
        and headed back out.

        Mr Lemon was busy trying to get the lawnmower to start, it always took
        quite a while. He would pull the chord, and the worn-out machine would
        almost rumble into life, but not quite. It took all of Mr Lemon's efforts
        and each pull would make him more frustrated. Seemingly, the lawnmower
        was also fuelled by frustration. It always started on his very last
        attempt, right before giving up.

    <p>
        The mower finally roared into life, oily smoke filled the air for a minute
        as the old motor shook and shuddered. When she was younger, the snarl of
        the lawnmower and the thought of its menacing blades had filled Penelope
        with terror, but now, she was far more interested in something else she
        was seeing for the first time.
    </p>

    <p>
        A small crowd of garden gnomes had gathered in front of the lawnmower,
        stretching, warming up and looking very excited. They were smiling,
        bouncing up and down, chattering together and preparing themselves for
        whatever was about to happen next. Penelope stood out of the way and
        watched, curiously. As Mr Lemon began to push the lawnmower across the
        long grass, the gnomes, laughing with glee, ran out in front, almost
        getting caught in the mower, but diving out of the way just in time. As
        the lawnmower was dragged backward over the already cut grass, they would
        fall back into position, howling with laughter and ready for the next
        forward offensive. Darting ahead of the mower, having the time of their
        lives, always just out of reach of the insatiably hungry machine being
        pushed toward them. While Mr Lemon was getting tired, sweaty and frankly
        grumpy, the gnomes were having so much fun. Penelope wished her father
        could see them, as it might have made him feel better about the job he
        felt condemned to do.

    <p>
        Penelope couldn't make out the gnomes very well from this vantage point.
        It all looked very perilous, but it was obviously something they had done
        before, so she decided not to concern herself too much. While she was
        having this thought, a gnome looked like he might have tripped over, right
        in front of the lawnmower. Not being able to see him, Mr Lemon pushed the
        lawnmower right over the gnome. Penelope's heart stopped. She began to
        panic. Surely, the gnome would be dead or very, very injured. Among the
        cut grass escaping from behind the lawnmower, Penelope saw something more
        solid fly up over Mr Lemon's shoulder and land with a small thud on a
        freshly cut patch of lawn, about three metres behind her father. Penelope,
        barely breathing, ran to see what it was.

    <p>
        There, lying on his back, was none other than Ted. Penelope looked down,
        fear on her face. Ted looked up, slightly embarrassed.
    </p>

    <p>
        'What?' Ted said, laughing. 'It's fun.' Ted leapt to his feet, seemingly
        unscathed, and ran back to join the scrum of gnomes in front of the
        lawnmower, cackling.
    </p>

    <p>
        Penelope was filled with relief, gnomes were even tougher than she had
        thought. She sat down on the path to watch her father finish mowing.
        Every now and then, another gnome would come hurtling out of the back
        of the lawnmower, whooping with laughter. She couldn't help but laugh
        along with them.
